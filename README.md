# Chess Stats & Tournament Tracker

A modern, unified stats platform for competitive chess - aggregating tournament data from Chess.com, Lichess, and FIDE in one clean interface. Think [VLR.gg](https://www.vlr.gg/) (Valorant's premier stats site) but for chess.

## Vision

The definitive stats hub for competitive chess where fans can view tournament results, explore player statistics, and track performance across all major platforms.

## Problem We're Solving

- **Fragmented Data**: Tournament stats and player performance scattered across Chess.com, Lichess, FIDE with no unified view
- **Outdated Interfaces**: Chess-Results.com (40,000+ tournaments) has a 2005-era UI that's difficult to navigate
- **Missing Analytics**: No unified player statistics or cross-platform performance tracking
- **Poor Historical Access**: Historical tournament data is hard to find and compare

## Core Features (MVP)

### 🗓️ Tournament Browser
- Clean list/calendar view of tournaments (past, present, upcoming)
- Filter by platform (Chess.com, Lichess, OTB), format (Swiss, Knockout), and date
- Search functionality

### 🏆 Tournament Stats Pages
- **Swiss Tournaments**: Final standings, round-by-round results, pairing history matrices
- **Knockout Tournaments**: Interactive bracket visualization with results
- Tournament metadata (format, time control, prize pool, participants)
- Individual player journey through each tournament

### 👤 Player Stats Profiles
- Unified ratings across platforms (FIDE, Chess.com, Lichess)
- Complete tournament history and results
- Career statistics: tournaments played, win rate, average placement, performance ratings
- Head-to-head records vs other players

### 📊 Initial Data Coverage
- Titled Tuesday (Chess.com weekly tournaments)
- Champions Chess Tour events
- Major FIDE events (World Championship, Candidates, Grand Swiss)

## Feature Roadmap

## Notes

- **Live Updates**: Tournament data is updated periodically (not real-time). Chess games don't require second-by-second precision.
- **User Accounts**: Not required for MVP. Will be added later for pick'ems and community features.
- **Focus**: This is a **stats tracking platform**, not a live broadcast or game playing platform.
